Miscellaneous utilities for XFS
-------------------------------

mkinitrd.xfs
	Russell's modified version of mkinitrd.  Notes from rlog:

	Modified mkinitrd: make it large enough to fit xfs and pagebuf (15meg)
	Use static version of bash rather than sash; sash doesn't seem to work.
	(bash.static not supplied must build your own).
	Note default ram disk size in the kernel is 4096k
	add append="ramdisk_size=15000" to lilo.conf

xfs_stats.pl
	Perl script to massage the /proc/fs/xfs/stat file into a readable
	format.  Use "perldoc xfs_stats.pl" to see the man page.  We dont
	install this script in xfsprogs, for example, as we don't want to
	introduce a prereq on perl just for this little script.

kiobuf_io.patch
	Patch (against the xfs tree at 2.4.3) to re-introduce the
	kiobuf based I/O patch. This code was removed due to change
	in direction in the community direction for the block I/O
	layer.
